v0.1.0

  * first release, so no changelog

v1.2.0

  * yearly archives commented so only user who want them can have it but it is not default
  * ordered list style added to the sidebar
  * added latest article to the sidebar
  * fix the style code to display non-widget lists properly; this should make widget replacements easy too

v1.2.1

  * very minor bug fixes and code cleansing
  * added all default Wordpress files after comparing with the Wordpress Default Theme (still left to work on the attachment.php and the comments-popup.php - they are perhaps the least used and least important, so I will take my time)

v1.2.3

  * gave names to the two sidebar widgets to make it easy for Admin to know which sidebar they are customizing.

v1.2.4

  * added contact template powered by Secure Email Form
  * article or blog post template modified to enhance google adsense placement
